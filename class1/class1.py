# Variable
# We use variables if we want to store some data to use it later and we can use it over and over again.
# Definition: named memory location is called a variable

# Ok so Memory location:
    # Memory- storage of computer
    # Location - place where the data will be stored.
    #Named - A name give to a memeory location.

# You can assign any name to a variable and that will be called an identifier, but there are some rules to keep in mind.

# How do we write a variable?

name = "Abby"

# How do we run a Python program?

# print ()

print("Hello this is abby")
print(435453)
# Python will treat these numbers as if they are simple english sentences
print('I am also a string and I can write 124444444')
