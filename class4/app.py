# Expression: combination of values and operators that produce a value
# operator (+) -> A symbol that performs some kind of operation on varaibles or values.

# operation on values (2, 3)
# 2 and 3 are the operands
# print(2 + 3)

abby_age = 45
alex_age = 67
# operation on variables
# abby_age alex_age are operands.
# print(abby_age + alex_age)
# print(abby_age - alex_age)
# division
# print(abby_age / alex_age)
# multiplication
# print(abby_age * alex_age)

# Binary Operator (The operators that combines two operands, all the above are binary operators)

# Modulus operator (%)
print("The remainder is: ", 12%7)


# increment
print(abby_age + 1)

# decrement
print(alex_age-1)

# Exponent: 2 multiplied for three different times (2*2*2)
print(2**3)
