# What are the rules to write variable names (Identi
hello = "goodbye"

# Writing variables the 9 rules.

# 1 Rule:
# The variable name must start with a letter or an underscore (_)
# age = 56 OR _age = 45 (Both of these are valid variable names because they start with a letter OR an _)
car = "Camry"
_laptop = "Dell"
_water = "aqua"


# 2 Rule: Identfiers cannot start with a number.
# 112hello = "value" (NOT valid bc it starts with a number.)
# 9ty = "value" It will generate a syntax Error.
_123 = "number"
# 234 = "wrong"

# 3 Rule: Only can contain the alpha numeric characters
amazon11 = "Daraz"
hello900 = "greeting"

# 4 Rule: Identifiers are case-sensative
abc = "hi"
Abc = "Helllooo"
# Both are different
ABC = 34
aBC = 23
Efg = 25
efg = 76

# 5 Rule: Keywords cannot be used as the name of the variables.
# keywords are the words that has a pre-defined meaning.
# for = 4555 Syntax error because we cannot use keywords as the variable names


#6 Rule: We cannot use spaces between the variable names if the variable is more than a single word
# your car = "Toyota"  (Invalid, No spaces allowed)
# my home = "city"

#7 Rule: cannot contain only digits
# 453245 = "value" wrong because these are digits only and it will give us Syntax error.
# 78909 = "incorrect"

#8 Rule: There is no limit on the lenght of the variable name.It can be a single character or it can 100s of characters
s = "Hiiii"
asdfahsdkjhfaklsjdhfklajhsdjkhfalksdhlfjahsdljhfajklshdlfahsdlkhfalkhsdlkfhaldshfladhsfjadslhfaldsjhfa = 56

#9 Rule: We can write numbers in between the letters or at the end of the letters
amazon11amazon = "Walmart" # valid
a11y = 34 #valid
a1 = 453246

greetings = "Hi there, I am your new instructor"
age = "455" # Number can be inside of quotation marks but that will change the data type of it meaning the code will treat as if it is normal english words.

# We dont need quotation marks for writing numbers as values
height = 170

# we also dont need quotation marks for variable names
print(height)
